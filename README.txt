IRON WORK LOG 2

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT
MAY HAVE UNKNOWN BUGS

Standalone work-tracking system, built on LOVE2D and Loveframes. Allows the user to keep a running log and metrics of their work-tasks, with the additional ability to publish to HTML, and FTP the log to any accessible webspace.

Note: If you want to customize your CSS and HTML templates, DON'T edit the defaultstyle and defaulthtml files! Instead, edit the "style.css" and "template.html" in your LOVE savedata folder. (On Windows, this is in a path something like "Users/YourName/AppData/Roaming/LOVE/savedata")



Special thanks to Kenny Shields, creator of Loveframes.
